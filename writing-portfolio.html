                <header class = "article-head"><h2><a href = "https://hanlapeno.wordpress.com/2020/12/17/celeste-how-a-platformer-does-plot/">Celeste – How a Platformer Does Plot</a></h2></header>
                <section class = "article-body">
                <p> 
                    Celeste was one of the biggest indie titles of 2018. 
                    It was beloved for its easy-to-grasp but difficult-to-master platforming mechanics. 
                    Combine that with its colourful pixel-art and its skilfully-made soundtrack, it’s no wonder 
                    that players and critics alike fell in love with the title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet the story and writing are what jumped out to me, as it was unlike any other platformer I’d ever played. 
                    It wasn’t a set of levels strung together by the excuse of having a princess to save. Nor was the plot hidden 
                    in the background, revealed only through cutscenes, as your character remained oblivious and unaffected by 
                    the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, Celeste offered glimpses into real characters with real struggles. 
                    The player was encouraged to empathize with them through both dialogue and gameplay. 
                    Making it all the more satisfying to see the main character grow and overcome their struggles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s this kind of storytelling that should be more common in videogames, and I think there are a few 
                    lessons that the industry’s writers and designers can learn from Celeste.
                </p>
                <h4>Blending Plot and Gameplay</h4>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most powerful of these lessons is to blend the plot and gameplay. This helps the player relate to 
                    their character as they’ll both share the same experience, in the same manner, with the same feelings. This 
                    immerses the player into the plot and makes them care for their character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Celeste does this early on when the main character first meets her doppelganger and is instilled with fear. 
                    The game helps you relate to her fear by speeding up and demanding that you run away. Your own heart beats 
                    faster and faster as you try to avoid being caught and restarting the level. By the time you escape the doppelganger 
                    and reach safety, you’re in tune with the main character and feel the same sense of relief.
                </p>
                <h4>Making the Story Personal</h4>
                <p>
                    Even if the game blends its plot and gameplay, it can still be hard to relate to the characters and events. That’s 
                    because the vast majority of games focus on external threats, with aliens, zombies, or corrupt organizations making 
                    up your typical opponent. It’s also always the fate of the world that’s at stake, and it can be hard for us to relate 
                    to something so grand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why more personal stories are needed in this medium, as they give a character the same struggles many of us face 
                    in our daily lives whether it’s dealing with the loss of a loved one, facing mental illness, or our struggles in becoming 
                    better versions of ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Celeste demonstrates this by focusing the story on the main character’s depression. The whole story is centred around her 
                    coming face to face with her mental illness, accepting it, and learning to overcome it. This is no doubt similar to the 
                    struggles felt by the game’s writer and many of its players.
                </p>
                <h4>Using Metaphors</h4>
                <p>
                    While metaphors aren’t required to make a good story, they’re still a powerful tool that often goes underutilized in the 
                    videogame industry. They can give a story more depth and nuance, without requiring much more effort on the writer’s part. 
                    Metaphors can also give the player a sense of pride as they’ve uncovered the story’s hidden meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it often feels like videogame writers don’t trust the player’s intelligence, as they feel the need to 
                    spell out every little detail instead of leaving some parts to be inferred. While this definitely isn’t the case in 
                    all games, it’s quite common in mainstream titles who, in their defence, are trying to go for a broad target audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can see Celeste successfully using metaphors on multiple occasions. The doppelganger that appears in the story is a 
                    clear representation of the main character’s depression and insecurity. The mountain being climbed is also a metaphor, 
                    and it represents the main characters internal struggles. Upon connecting these dots and understanding what’s really going 
                    on, the player feels more invested in Celeste since they played a vital role in uncovering the secrets of the story.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    By learning to blend plot and gameplay, writing more personal stories, and using metaphors as part of their writing toolbox, 
                    videogame writers can push the medium to new heights. They’ll be able to create stories that touch the heart, make you think, 
                    and that are truly unforgettable.

                    <h2>Why Killing Bats is Ineffective and Inhumane</h2>
                </header>
                <section class = "article-body">
                    <h3>Methods Used to Kill Bats</h3>
                    <p>
                        When put in a difficult situation, a lot of people will choose the quick and easy route. In the case of a bat infestation, 
                        this involves killing the animals as quickly as possible. While there are many ways to go about doing this, these are three 
                        of the most common methods.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Poison</h4>
                    <p>
                        A lot of people mistakenly think that poison is effective at removing wildlife infestations. Yet this couldn’t be farther from 
                        the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People make this mistake because they don’t understand the difference between pest control and wildlife removal. The former is 
                        concerned with removing small insects, something which can be done with the use of poison. Yet the same can’t be said for wildlife 
                        removal which deals with larger animals like bats, mice, and raccoons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason you can’t use poison to kill bats and other large animals is because of the way poison works. These chemicals get inside 
                        an animal’s body and start destroying the cells. Eventually, the animal will die because a lot of their cells have been ruined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, if an animal is bigger, they’ll have more cells. That means you’ll need more poison (or a more concentrated dosage) to get the 
                        same result. That’s why bigger animals are more resistant to poison. It’s also why insecticides will successfully kill bugs but 
                        will only give you a headache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So using poison to kill bats may kill a few of them, but the vast majority will stay alive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poison can also cause a lot of problems, as you’ll then have to find all the dead bats and remove them. This is dangerous as it can 
                        lead to the spread of disease. It’s also difficult and time-consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poison is also very inhumane as it causes internal bleeding, hemorrhaging, and other disturbing symptoms. These fill the bat’s last 
                        moments with pure agony.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Lethal Traps</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some people are tempted to remove bats by using lethal traps like glue traps. Not only are these traps inhumane, but they do a terrible 
                        job of removing the bats and solving the underlying issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glue traps work by preventing the animal from moving after they’ve been caught. This means the animal will die of thirst or starvation, 
                        which is disturbing and inhumane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bats are also flying animals, so they’re far less likely to fall for these traps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bat infestations are also large, so using traps will take a long time and will be ineffective.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Physical Attacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        You could always try to hit the bats to kill them, but this is a terrible idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of bats in an infestation and they can fly, so killing them one by one will be difficult and will take you a long time. Bats 
                        also carry plenty of diseases, so trying to kill them using this method could be more dangerous for you than for the bats.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Killing Bats in the United States</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the ineffectiveness and inhumanity of those methods weren’t enough to convince you, you’ll still have to stop using those methods as killing 
                        bats is illegal in the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These animals have been endangered and their populations have been in decline for years, so the government has set laws to protect these animals 
                        so they don’t go extinct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also in your best interest to stop killing bats as these animals help kill insects. In fact, studies show that a single bat can kill upwards 
                        of four-thousand insects a night!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Alternative Bat Removal Methods</h3>
                    <h4>Using Exclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exclusion is the most popular choice for bat removal. The idea is to make some small changes to your home so that the bats can go out and hunt at 
                        night but can’t re-enter your home at dawn. This results in the bats slowly leaving off on their own with little effort on your part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is commonly done by placing one-way doors on the pathways used by bats.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bat Prevention</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prevention is an even better method, as you won’t risk getting sick or having your home damaged. This method is also easy, and it only involves 
                        repairing your home’s walls and roofs if there are any holes the bats can use to get inside!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should also cover up your vents and chimney, as these are other common entry points.

                <section class = "article-body">
                    <p>
                        Tuna is a delicious fish, both in real life and in video games. In <em>Stardew Valley</em>, it’s used for a number of recipes 
                        including fish tacos and sashimi. It can even be used to make quality fertilizer and the ocean fish bundle. So, 
                        if you’re having trouble finding Stardew Valley tuna, you came to the right place.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Where to Find Tuna in <em>Stardew Valley</em>?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you think finding tuna is going to be a massive grind in one tiny part of the map, then shed away your fears, 
                        because catching tuna is simple and straightforward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To find the fish, simply head south of Pelican Town and down to the ocean and begin fishing. A good place to set up shop 
                        is by Willy’s Fish Shop, so you can get more supplies if you need them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, keep the seasons in mind when deciding to go hunting for tuna, as the fish can only be caught in the summer and winter. 
                        Also you’ll want to be sure to go during the day, since the fish can’t be caught at night — so no midnight fishing trips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surprisingly enough, that isn’t the only place to find tuna in <em>Stardew Valley</em>, as there’s a small chance of it spawning in garbage 
                        cans during summer and winter. Feel free to go dumpster diving if you fancy your luck.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to Catch Tuna in <em>Stardew Valley</em>?</h4>

                        Catching tuna is just like catching any other fish in <em>Stardew Valley</em>. All you have to do is equip a fishing rod and throw the line 
                        out into the water. Then just wait until a fish bites — indicated by an exclamation mark and the game saying “HIT!” — then just 
                        click to start the mini-game.
                    </p>

                        Now here’s the tricky part, to beat the mini-game and catch the fish, you’ll have to keep a rectangle near the moving fish icon until a bar 
                        fills up completely. It sounds easier than it is, but after practicing it once or twice, you’ll get the hang of it.

                        Now that you know where and how to catch tuna in <em>Stardew Valley</em>, so head on out and reel in those fish.
