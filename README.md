# Sobhan-M.github.io
Sobhan-M.github.io is a custom website, created from the ground up and hosted right here on GitHub.
The goal of this repository/site is to allow me to practice and show off what I've learnt. The website also acts as a neat little resume that I can use to help get work in the future.
## Completion:
The website was successfully completed on 28-Dec-2020. Going forward, it will only be updated every once in a while to ensure the content remains relevant. No major restructuring will take place in the foreseeable future.
