# Sobhan-M.github.io
Sobhan-M.github.io is a custom website, created from the ground up and hosted right here on GitHub.
The goal of this repository/site is to allow me to practice and show off what I've learnt. The website also acts as a neat little resume that I can use to help get work in the future.
