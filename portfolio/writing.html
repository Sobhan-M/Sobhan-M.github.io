                    <h2>Why Killing Bats is Ineffective and Inhumane</h2>
                    <h3>Methods Used to Kill Bats</h3>
                    <p>
                        When put in a difficult situation, a lot of people will choose the quick and easy route. In the case of a bat infestation, 
                        this involves killing the animals as quickly as possible. While there are many ways to go about doing this, these are three 
                        of the most common methods.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Poison</h4>
                    <p>
                        A lot of people mistakenly think that poison is effective at removing wildlife infestations. Yet this couldn’t be farther from 
                        the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People make this mistake because they don’t understand the difference between pest control and wildlife removal. The former is 
                        concerned with removing small insects, something which can be done with the use of poison. Yet the same can’t be said for wildlife 
                        removal which deals with larger animals like bats, mice, and raccoons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason you can’t use poison to kill bats and other large animals is because of the way poison works. These chemicals get inside 
                        an animal’s body and start destroying the cells. Eventually, the animal will die because a lot of their cells have been ruined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, if an animal is bigger, they’ll have more cells. That means you’ll need more poison (or a more concentrated dosage) to get the 
                        same result. That’s why bigger animals are more resistant to poison. It’s also why insecticides will successfully kill bugs but 
                        will only give you a headache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So using poison to kill bats may kill a few of them, but the vast majority will stay alive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poison can also cause a lot of problems, as you’ll then have to find all the dead bats and remove them. This is dangerous as it can 
                        lead to the spread of disease. It’s also difficult and time-consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poison is also very inhumane as it causes internal bleeding, hemorrhaging, and other disturbing symptoms. These fill the bat’s last 
                        moments with pure agony.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Lethal Traps</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some people are tempted to remove bats by using lethal traps like glue traps. Not only are these traps inhumane, but they do a terrible 
                        job of removing the bats and solving the underlying issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glue traps work by preventing the animal from moving after they’ve been caught. This means the animal will die of thirst or starvation, 
                        which is disturbing and inhumane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bats are also flying animals, so they’re far less likely to fall for these traps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bat infestations are also large, so using traps will take a long time and will be ineffective.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Physical Attacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        You could always try to hit the bats to kill them, but this is a terrible idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of bats in an infestation and they can fly, so killing them one by one will be difficult and will take you a long time. Bats 
                        also carry plenty of diseases, so trying to kill them using this method could be more dangerous for you than for the bats.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Killing Bats in the United States</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the ineffectiveness and inhumanity of those methods weren’t enough to convince you, you’ll still have to stop using those methods as killing 
                        bats is illegal in the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These animals have been endangered and their populations have been in decline for years, so the government has set laws to protect these animals 
                        so they don’t go extinct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also in your best interest to stop killing bats as these animals help kill insects. In fact, studies show that a single bat can kill upwards 
                        of four-thousand insects a night!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Alternative Bat Removal Methods</h3>
                    <h4>Using Exclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exclusion is the most popular choice for bat removal. The idea is to make some small changes to your home so that the bats can go out and hunt at 
                        night but can’t re-enter your home at dawn. This results in the bats slowly leaving off on their own with little effort on your part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is commonly done by placing one-way doors on the pathways used by bats.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bat Prevention</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prevention is an even better method, as you won’t risk getting sick or having your home damaged. This method is also easy, and it only involves 
                        repairing your home’s walls and roofs if there are any holes the bats can use to get inside!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should also cover up your vents and chimney, as these are other common entry points.
                    </p>
