                <h3> Freelance Content Writer </h3>
                <h5> May, 2020 - Current</h4>
                <p> 
                    After the COVID-19 pandemic took away my other sources of income, 
                    I decided to make the best of the situation and try to make an income online. 
                    Writing was the one skill I thought I would do best at, as I had been paid for my
                    writing a few times in the past.
                </p>
                <h5> Description </h5>
                <p>
                    My clients send the topic they want written, as well as the word count they want.
                    My job is to research the topic to find useful information, and write the articles, blogs,
                    or copies my clients want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm happy to report that my clients are more than happy with my work, and I've
                    continuously tried to improve my craft by taking reputable seminars.
                </p>

                <h3> Freelance Photographer </h3>
                <h5> September, 2019 - March, 2020 </h5>
                <p>
                    I started doing freelance photography after I moved to Montreal and started University.
                    I used my hobby to make a bit of income to support my studies until I could find a 
                    more reliable form of employment. Unfortunately, finding even basic work without speaking 
                    French in Montreal proved much harder than I imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why my temporary means of income lasted for longer than I would have expected, 
                    before coming to an end because of the COVID-19 lockdowns.

                <h5>Company Details</h5>
                <p>
                    ServCorp is a provider of serviced offices, meeting rooms, coworking spaces, and virtual offices. 
                    They are international company, but I interned at the branch operating out of Emirates Towers, Dubai.

                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>
                    I worked closely with the marketing team. I was given a broad range of tasks during my short time at the company.
                    My tasks included auditing websites, translating information to be used in creating the website of a new branch,
                    minor website development, market research, and did some training with Google Ads.
